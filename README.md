## 🔥 About the CTF

Welcome to our writeup vault for **CyberSecure-X CTF 2025**, a premier cybersecurity competition hosted by **KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad**.

Our squad, **"Your Team"**, battled it out in the **online qualifiers**, solving intense challenges across web, pwn, reverse, forensics, crypto, and more — and emerged **2nd on the scoreboard**, clinching a spot in the **offline finals**.

This repo is our war log 🗂️ — documenting how we cracked each challenge, our tools of choice, and the path we took from confusion to flag.
